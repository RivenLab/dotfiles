# Dotfiles

## Usage 

1. Clone Repo
```
git clone https://github.com/RivenLab/dotfiles.git
```

2. Change to the cloned directory: 
```
cd dotfiles
```

3. Initialize the configuration using stow with your desired directory name:

```
stow $Directory_name
```

Replace $Directory_name with the name of the directory you wish to configure using stow. This setup will symlink the appropriate dotfiles from the repository to your home directory.
